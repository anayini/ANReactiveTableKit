# ANReactiveTableKit

*A React-style API for UITableView heavily influenced by [ReactiveLists](github.com/plangrid/ReactiveLists).*

`ANReactiveTableKit` is an experiment in providing a similar React-style API as ReactiveLists.  It requires iOS 13+ to be able to use some of the latest APIs to simplify what ReactiveLists was attempting to do and eliminate the need for any third party dependencies.

After working on ReactiveLists at PlanGrid, I wanted to see if we could simplify the library by using the latest Apple APIs.  To do this, thsi library requires iOS 13+, which wasn't something ReactiveLists was able to do at this time.

## Requirements

* Xcode 11.0+
* iOS 13+

## Installation

This code is currently only available as a Swift Package.
